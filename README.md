# Debby Peam

Repository for my very first mod for PEAK, Debby Peam! Just a collection of things I think are cool and what's suggested to me!

You can use the [Issues](https://github.com/TheDebbyCase/DebbyPeam/issues) tab to submit any problems with the mod, or any suggestions you may have.
Suggestions can also be made directly to me if you can find me on Discord, or on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/thedebbycase.bsky.social)!

If you wish you can also donate to me over on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/thedebbycase)!
